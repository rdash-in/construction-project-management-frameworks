# Construction Project Management Frameworks

This repository documents practical frameworks used by construction,
design & build, and contracting companies to manage projects,
control cashflows, and reduce margin leakage.

## Golden Journey of Construction Management

The Golden Journey framework explains the full lifecycle of a
construction project across seven stages:

1. Recce (Site Survey)
2. Design
3. Bill of Quantities (BOQ)
4. Orders & Procurement
5. Work Progress Tracking
6. Snags & Audits
7. Financial Closure

The framework focuses on BOQ-centric execution, linking project
progress with cashflow, and improving coordination between
design, projects, procurement, and finance teams.

This framework is widely applicable for:
- Construction companies
- Design & build firms
- Interior fit-out contractors
- MEP contractors

A detailed whitepaper is available in this repository.
